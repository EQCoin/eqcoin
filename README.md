&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EQcoin is the world's first Passport-based Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem of the people, by the people, for the people. EQcoin is an open-source, decentralized, permissionless, distributed, and publicly shared digital ledger. Passport and EQC (an abbreviation for "EQcoin") are the original commodities of the EQcoin ecosystem. Passport and EQC are issued and circulated in accordance with the EQcoin consensus mechanism, which operates on decentralized finance principles. This enables everyone to participate in the issuance and circulation of Passport and EQC through crowdsourcing. The development of EQcoin is based on crowdsourcing. Everyone can contribute to the enhancement and refinement of EQcoin through the EQcoin Improvement Proposal (EIP).
